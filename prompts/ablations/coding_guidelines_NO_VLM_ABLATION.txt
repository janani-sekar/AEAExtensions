Guidelines for constructing the analyses (no VLM):
    1. Focus on the central empirical question in the paper; propose analyses that are novel relative to both the paper and prior attempts.
    2. The output of the code should only be text. Do not produce figures in this ablation.
    3. Use statistical tests appropriately. Report effect sizes and standard errors (robust or clustered) and p-values.
    4. Consider fixed effects, controls, and identification assumptions. If panel data, consider DID/event study; if endogeneity, consider IV.
    5. Suggest novelty through alternative specifications, robustness checks, and heterogeneity analyses.
    6. Each analysis must be self-contained and runnable with the provided dataset only.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: {available_packages}. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Use only columns present in the provided dataset.
    9. The path to the dataset is {adata_path}
    10. The analysis should focus on one core hypothesis.
    11. Do not reload data if df exists; the dataset is already available as a pandas DataFrame named df.
    12. Analyses should be standard, credible empirical methods that the paper may have missed.
