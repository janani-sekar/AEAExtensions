Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. Focus on the central empirical question in the paper, but propose analyses that are novel relative to both the paper and prior attempts. Avoid duplicating the paper.
    2. Use standard econometric practice. Report effect sizes with appropriate standard errors (robust or clustered) and p-values where relevant.
    3. Create figures where informative (e.g., coefficient plots, event-study graphs, distribution plots, residual diagnostics). If multiple figures are useful, lay them out clearly.
    4. Structure analyses to be interpretable: state the estimand, identification assumptions, and key controls/fixed effects.
    5. When suggesting novel analyses, consider alternative specifications (controls, fixed effects), robustness checks, heterogeneity analyses, and complementary identification strategies (e.g., IV, DID, event study), consistent with the dataset.
    6. Each analysis must be self-contained and runnable without external data. Use only the dataset provided.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: {available_packages}. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Use only columns present in the provided dataset. Leverage as much metadata/column information as possible.
    9. The path to the dataset is {adata_path}
    10. The analysis should focus on one core goal/hypothesis and proceed step-by-step to test it.
    11. Do not reload data from disk inside steps; the dataset is already available in the notebook (as a pandas DataFrame named df for tabular data, or as an AnnData object named adata for h5ad). Prefer df if present and never reference adata if df exists.
    12. Display all figures in the notebook. Never save to files.
    13. Favor standard, credible empirical methods that the paper may have missed.
