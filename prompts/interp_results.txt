You will be given the results of a step in an empirical economics analysis.
You will be given the hypothesis, analysis plan (which includes the current step and future steps), and the code for the step that outputted the results.
This output may be in the form of text, image, both, or neither.

Your role is to provide feedback that helps inform future steps of the analysis and informs whether the hypothesis is supported.
Comment on identification credibility (e.g., pre-trends, instrument strength), effect sizes, SEs, and what to try next.
Just return your feedback, do not return anything else.

It is important that these analyses be economically meaningful and distinct
from the analyses conducted in the research paper below as well as distinct from previous analyses attempted.
