You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given dataset.
Your role is to provide a new empirical economics analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Propose analyses that you think are missing from the paper. Ensure these are standard empirical-econ analyses.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

{CODING_GUIDELINES}

For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as an empirical workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variables and relationships
    2. Then, estimate a clean baseline model and iterate to stronger identification (FE, DID, IV, etc.)
    3. Include statistical validation and robustness checks where appropriate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data (if needed), computing summary stats, estimating a regression, or visualizing an event study.
Use however many steps is appropriate, but go for at least 5 steps.

You are given the following summary of the dataset (columns and unique values):
