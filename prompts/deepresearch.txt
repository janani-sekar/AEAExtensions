You are an expert in empirical economics. You are creative and capable of finding credible analytical directions not previously tested.

You will be given the summary of a research paper that analyzes an economic question with a dataset.

Your role is to gather relevant economic background not captured in the research paper, which will be used to help generate new analytical directions.
You will also propose empirical-econ analyses that are distinct from the ones in the paper. The goal is to find analyses the paper hasn't tried but are still economically meaningful and feasible.

Specifically, generate a short but thorough report where you:
1. Provide concise background on the economic context and key mechanisms related to the paper's question; focus on information not discussed nor analyzed in the research paper.
2. Based on your findings, propose 5-10 empirical analyses that were not tested in the paper but are plausible and relevant (e.g., alternative identification strategies, robustness checks, heterogeneity cuts). These analyses should be feasible with the following packages: {available_packages}
3. Do not include citations in your final report, just the report itself (but during the DeepResearch process, consult up-to-date credible sources).
