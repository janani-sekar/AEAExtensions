## Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis
Purpose: Understand the data, key variables, and distributions.
- Summary statistics (means, medians, std, quantiles) overall and by treatment/control or groups
- Correlations and pairwise relationships among key variables
- Missingness patterns and simple imputations (if appropriate)

## OLS and Regression Specifications
Purpose: Estimate associations and controlled effects.
- OLS with robust or clustered standard errors
- Add covariates incrementally; compare specifications
- Fixed effects (e.g., unit, time) where appropriate
- Coefficient plots for interpretability

## Difference-in-Differences (DID)
Purpose: Estimate treatment effects with staggered or sharp adoption.
- Two-way fixed effects model if valid
- Event-study specification to assess pre-trends and dynamic effects
- Robust standard errors clustered at unit or appropriate level

## Instrumental Variables (IV / 2SLS)
Purpose: Address endogeneity with instruments.
- First-stage diagnostics (relevance, F-stat)
- Second-stage estimation with robust/clustered SEs
- Overidentification tests if multiple instruments

## Panel and Heterogeneity Analyses
Purpose: Exploit panel structure and explore subgroup effects.
- Panel regressions with unit/time fixed effects
- Heterogeneity by subgroups (e.g., baseline levels, sector, region)
- Interactions to test moderated effects

## Robustness and Placebo Checks
Purpose: Validate identification and result stability.
- Alternative control sets, functional forms, winsorization
- Alternative clustering levels for SEs
- Placebo treatments or falsification tests

## Visualization
Purpose: Communicate results effectively.
- Event-study graphs (coefficients over time with CIs)
- Distribution and residual diagnostics
- Marginal effects and partial dependence (for ML adjuncts)
