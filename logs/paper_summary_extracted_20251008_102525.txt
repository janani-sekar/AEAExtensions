**Summary of NBER Working Paper 32272: "Apart but Connected: Online Tutoring, Cognitive Outcomes, and Soft Skills"**

**Research Question:** The paper examines the effects of an online tutoring program (Tutoring Online Program - TOP) on academic performance and non-cognitive outcomes such as aspirations and psychological well-being for underprivileged students, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Datasets:** The analysis utilizes administrative data and individual surveys collected from treated and control groups in TOP 2020 and TOP 2022. The sample includes 1,059 students in 2020 and 1,137 in 2022, with surveys measuring various outcomes.

**Key Variables:**
- **Likely Outcome:** Math academic performance (standardized test scores, teacher-assigned grades, failure rates) and non-academic outcomes (aspirations, socio-emotional skills, well-being).
- **Treatment:** Assignment of a tutor (3 or 6 hours per week during the program).
- **Time:** Evaluations focus on performance during the spring 2020 and school year 2022.
- **Unit:** Middle school students, grades 6-8.

**Identification Strategy:** The authors employ a randomized controlled trial design, leveraging random assignment to determine treatment status, allowing for causal inference through Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis with robust standard errors. Comparisons are made for students receiving 3 versus 6 hours of tutoring in 2020, and individual versus group tutoring in 2022.

**Notable Caveats:**
1. **Attrition Bias:** Differences in endline survey completion between treatment and control groups may introduce bias, with treated students showing higher completion rates.
2. **Limited Generalizability:** Results are based on a specific context in Italy and may not be applicable elsewhere. Mixed results for some non-cognitive outcomes in 2022 suggest variability in effectiveness depending on external conditions (e.g., in-person schooling).
3. **No Professional Tutors:** The effectiveness of university volunteers compared to professional tutors may impact the results and their scalability. 

Overall, the paper provides compelling evidence for the efficacy of volunteer-led online tutoring, significantly impacting math performance and socio-emotional well-being, especially prominent during the pandemic's isolation period.
